Escape from Narlilia is a text based adventure made with Python.
You are playing as a friend of a programmer that just made his escape simulator game and you're there to test it.

You have to make simple chooses to try to make it to the end. Survival is not ensured.
This game is based on stories of refugee's.
## Installation

## about
This is my first periode's assignment for my software developer course at Mediacollege Amsterdam.

My assignment was to make a text based adventure game about a refugee fleeing there country.
This assigment was setup so that we could explore how it is to be newcomer in a strange environment.
### timeline

I started creating the game enigne and asked for some help form fellow students. After that I wrote the story.
I technically needed to make a flow chart for it but I kind forgot to do that and directly maked my story as I went.

### self reflection

Making this assignment maked me release that we have it pretty good here. We don't need to worry about war, getting killed for believe or political reasons, having bad living conditions and alot more other stuff. I also noticed during making this that its handy to have flow chart prepared so that you know better how you want the story to flow. And I found out that I maybe don't need to write so much stuff. I also needed to have start working on this earlier on this project so that I can ask people for feedback and put that in my code.
